# ü¶ô Llama Tamer

**A lightweight, personal chat UI for Ollama with live, real-time web search capabilities.**

LlamaTamer is a simple, self-hosted, and intuitive frontend for interacting with local language models through Ollama. Its standout feature is the ability to "tame" your LLM by providing it with live web search results, giving it access to up-to-the-minute information and reducing hallucinations.

It runs as a simple Node.js server with a clean vanilla JavaScript frontend, making it fast, portable, and easy to modify.
